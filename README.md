# <Professional-README.md-generator>

## Description

This app was created as a project for the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. This project was designed to create a professional and immediately presentable README.md file for the user to deploy as needed. This project is intended to provide a neat and painless way to create README.md files from the user's terminal, without requiring editing, and in a simple, question-based format. In writing this project, I became deeply familiar with writing javaScript code utilizing Node.js, template literals, string interpolation, and modularizing code for use and readability. I have also learned a great deal about writing README.md files with Markdown.
